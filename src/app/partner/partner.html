            Two football legends, one iconic collaboration. Adidas brings together Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham —
            both global ambassadors and timeless representatives of the brand’s excellence on and off the field. This
            partnership celebrates their unmatched legacy and influence on football culture, fashion, and youth
            movements around the world.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Zidane, known for his elegance and intelligence on the pitch, famously wore the Predator Accelerator during
            his 1998 World Cup triumph. Beckham, celebrated for his precision and free-kicks, made the Predator Precision
            an icon. Adidas honored both players with special edition boots — Zidane's in gold and Beckham's in a red-and-white
            design — blending heritage with innovation.

            Adidas Originals and Wales Bonner return for their Spring/Summer 2025 collection, inspired by the energy of port towns where cultures meet. The collection blends city life with coastal charm.

            The footwear collection introduces a new Wales Bonner-designed silhouette along with two updated adidas classics.
            The WB Karintha is a completely new design with a sleek sole and two stylish versions—one with sequins and satin, the other in soft toffee suede with subtle stripes. The WB Superstar Hi updates the classic with a slimmer sole and suede material. The Adilette slide is reimagined with a leather footbed and a handwoven leather strap made in Brazil.
            The campaign highlights the blend of city energy and peaceful seaside vibes. Featuring footballer Raphinha and other fresh faces, it captures stories of balance between urban life and nature.
